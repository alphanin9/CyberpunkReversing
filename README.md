# Some scripts for Cyberpunk 2077 reverse engineering

Mostly made for personal use. Have some neat features and should work on Patch 2.2.

### Address helper

- Helps get address hashes and jump to them
- TODO: add feature to load C++ header with address hash list and check if all of them are present

### Find all RTTI types

- Helps with reversing classes that have RTTI definition 
- Renames them + their ctors + their vtables + their type object
